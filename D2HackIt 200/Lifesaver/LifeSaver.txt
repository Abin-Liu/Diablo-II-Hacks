"LifeSaver" is a D2hackit 2.00 module. This module basically offers two categories of features:
1) automatically reacts when player is threaten and
2) greatly simplified some time-critical game operations, such as "save & exit", "TP to town" 
so that one single key stroke will get the job done, those are especially important for Hardcore players.

Requirements: D2hackit 2.00 or higher
