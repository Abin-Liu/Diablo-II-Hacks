Bind 4.00 for D2HackIt!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module maps keys to commands and/or re-maps keys.

Commands:
  .bind keycode
       Shows the keycode of the next key you press

  .bind set <keycode> <returncode> [command1[;command2;...;commandN]]
       Binds the key with <keycode> to return <returncode> to game.
	   If [command] is present, it executes this command as well.
	   If you wish to use multiple commands, seperate commands by a ";".
	   You can use any command from D2HackIt! If you wish to put a "|" in
	   your command (helpful for the rotating command for you power users),
           you can now put a "`" (the character on the "~" key).
           Just remember to omit the "." in front of the command.

  .bind add <keycode> [command1[;command2;...;commandN]]
       Adds commands to the key with <keycode>.
	   If you wish to add multiple commands, seperate commands by a ";".
	   You can use any command from D2HackIt! If you wish to put a "|" in
	   your command (helpful for the rotating command for you power users),
           you can now put a "`" (the character on the "~" key).
           Just remember to omit the "." in front of the command and that you
	   must "set" the key before using this. 

  .bind rotate <keycode>
       Rotate the commands for <keycode> instead of using them all at once.

  .bind unset <keycode>
       Returns key with <keycode> to normal state (no remap, no command)

  .bind list
       Shows a list of all keys currently defined.
 
  .bind clear
       Removes all bind definitions (Return all keys to normal)

  .bind load [section]
       Loads a section of bind definitions from [section] bind.ini

  .bind save [section]
       Saves all current bind definitions to [section] in bind.ini.

  .bind help
       Shows help

Installation:
  Copy bind.d2h and bind.ini to your D2HackIt folder and use ".load bind" to 
  load the module.

Tips:
  ".bind set 70 0" will completely kill F1 from the game
  ".bind set 70 70 say I just hit F1" will show a text message when hitting F1
  and send F1 to the game for processing.
  ".bind set 70 71" and ".bind set 71 70" will map F1 to F2 and D2 to F1.
  ".bind set 70 70 say I just hit F1;say now what do I say?" will show "I just hit F1"
  and "now what do I say?"
  ".bind rotate 70" will cause the commands to rotate. So if you use the example above
  in conjunction with this, the first time it would say "I just hit F1". The second time you
  hit it, it would say "now what do I say?"
