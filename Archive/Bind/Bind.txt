Bind 3.02 for D2HackIt!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

This module maps keys to commands and/or re-maps keys. While still named "bind",
this module has been completely rewritten for being 1.10 compatible.

Requirements:
  D2HackIt! for 1.10

Commands:
  .bind keycode
       Shows the keycode of the next key you press

  .bind set <keycode> <returncode> [command1[;command2;...;commandN]]
       Binds the key with <keycode> to return <returncode> to game.
	   If [command] is present, it executes this command as well.
	   If you wish to use multiple commands, seperate commands by a ";".
	   You can use any command from D2HackIt! Just remember to omit
           the "." in front of the command.

  .bind unset <keycode>
       Returns key with <keycode> to normal state (no remap, no command)

  .bind list
       Shows a list of all keys currently defined.
 
  .bind clear
       Removes all bind definitions (Return all keys to normal)

  .bind reload
       Reloads bind definitions from bind.ini 

  .bind help
       Shows help

Installation:
  Copy bind.d2h and bind.ini to your D2HackIt folder and use ".load bind" to 
  load the module.

Tips:
  ".bind set 70 0" will completely kill F1 from the game
  ".bind set 70 70 say I just hit F1" will show a text message when hitting F1
  and send F1 to the game for processing.
  ".bind set 70 71" and ".bind set 71 70" will map F1 to F2 and F2 to F1.
  ".bind set 70 70 say I just hit F1;say now what do I say?" will show "I just hit F1"
  and "now what do I say?"
