"HC Module" is a D2hackit module. This module basically offers two categories of features:
1) automatically reacts when player is threaten and
2) greatly simplified some time-critical game operations, such as "save & exit", "TP to town" 
so that one single key stroke will get the job done, those are especially important for Hardcore players.

Requirements: D2hackit 110

Features:

1: Quit to channel(NOT shut down game) if HP is low or player is hostiled.
2: TP to town if HP is low or player is hostiled.
3: Auto drink potions when HP/mana is low.
4: Client view synchronization(anti black-wall) by one single key-stroke.
5: Fast "save & exit" by one single key-stroke.
6: Fast "Cast a town portal walk in" by one single key-stroke
